The main repository is owned by cumulus5. The other users line vasil will fork
the repo and create PRs. The test could be done from the same system by having
two browsers using different GitHub accounts. For example Firefox logged in
as cumulus5 and Chrome logged in as vasil. The changes on the files can be
done either on the GitHub directly or using leo with two ssh sessions, one
for cumulus5 and one for vasil.
